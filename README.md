# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical and sensory features. It leverages machine learning algorithms to provide predictions for the quality of different wine samples.

# Overview

Wine Quality Prediction is a data-driven project that aims to help wine producers and connoisseurs assess and improve the quality of their wines. By using a dataset containing wine attributes and quality ratings, the project develops machine learning models that can predict wine quality based on these attributes.

# Features

Utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of wines, including acidity, alcohol content, and pH, along with sensory information.
Implements different machine learning algorithms for regression to predict wine quality.
Provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and the performance of machine learning models.

# Installation

Make sure to install the required Python libraries and dependencies by running the following commands:


pip install pandas

pip install numpy

pip install scikit-learn

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install jupyter

# Getting Started

To start working with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone(https://github.com/jmdharshana/Wine-Quality-Prediction)

Navigate to the project directory: cd wine-quality-prediction

Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository to explore data, train models, and make wine quality predictions.

# Dataset

The project uses a dataset that contains information on various chemical properties and sensory attributes of different wine samples. The dataset also includes a quality rating, which serves as the target variable for prediction.

# Algorithms

The project explores various machine learning regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to build predictive models for wine quality. Each algorithm is evaluated for its accuracy in predicting wine quality ratings.

# Model Evaluation

The performance of each machine learning algorithm is assessed using regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared value (R2). These metrics help evaluate the accuracy of wine quality predictions.
